What were the challenges of the coursework and how did you deal with them?
 - deciding what processing models and algorithms to use (decided to go with what was simplest first to get a working solution then planned to improve on it.
  so that meant no processing model, and just processing the entire table at each step. essentially a direct 1-1 mapping of the relational algebra expressions.

How did you decide tuning parameters like join order?
 - It seemed intuitive to join the smaller table first and online references seemed to back up that intuition
